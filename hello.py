##little writeup

st.write("""American farming is a majority family-run industry. In 2021, the USDA found that 98% of farms were family-run,

        with 89% of farms also being small-scale operations (referring to farms with a gross profit under $250,000/year).

       The farm industry does not offer much financial stability, with 73.2% of all farms considered high risk, with less

       than 10% of their income considered profit (known as the ‚Äúred zone‚Äù). Over the past decade, the percentage of small

       farms operating in the red zone has been steadily rising.""")

        their crops for less than it cost to produce them. Severe weather events, increasingly unpredictable with climate change,

        exacerbate this issue. Thousands of farms have ceased operations, with the US Department of Agriculture estimating that the

       farm sector‚Äôs debt is set to rise to a whopping $540.8 billion in 2024. Farmer deaths by suicide and other mental health

        struggles have been a large issue since the 1980s, with the CDC reporting the Agricultural industry to have the fourth highest

        rates of suicide among all occupations.""")
